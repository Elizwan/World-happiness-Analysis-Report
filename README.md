# World Happiness Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the World Happiness Report dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques. It aims to uncover key factors contributing to happiness across different countries.

## Files in This Repository
- `World_Happiness_Analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.

## Key Insights
- Countries with higher GDP per capita, social support, and freedom to make life choices tend to have higher happiness scores.
- Scandinavian countries (Finland, Denmark, Norway) consistently rank among the happiest, possibly due to strong social welfare systems and high living standards.
- The correlation between GDP per capita and happiness suggests that economic prosperity contributes significantly to overall well-being.
